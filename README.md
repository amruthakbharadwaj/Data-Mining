Predictive Modeling for Credit Card Marketing Using JMP:

Goal of this project is to predict if a bank customer accepts the credit card or not. As the response variable is categorical (either Yes or No) and has a large number of potential predictor variables, different supervised data mining models like K-NN, Classification Tree, Bootstrap Forest, Boosted Tree, logistic regression, and Neural networks are applied.

Data pre-processing: As the data set contained 18,000 records, 5000 records were selected randomly for analysis. The data was partitioned 60:40 for training and validation set respectively using “Formula Random” option in JMP to protect model against overfitting.
